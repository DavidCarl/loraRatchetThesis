# Raspberry Pi demos

## Build

### Automated

By using the included script there are a few prerequisites. You will need the tool called `sshpass`. This is avaible in different package managers, eg. arch https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/sshpass/

Now you would need to change the following things in the script. server and client `password`, `username` and `ip`. Theses changes should make it so when you run the script, it automaticly compiles and SCP the files to the client and server raspberry pi.

### Manually

This can be done with .... docker tool here
